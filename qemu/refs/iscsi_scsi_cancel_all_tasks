 * This function is used when you want to cancel all scsi tasks.
 * The callback for the tasks will immediately be invoked with SCSI_STATUS_CANCELLED.
 * The cancellation is only local in libiscsi. If the tasks are already in-flight
 * this call will not cancel the tasks at the target.
 * To cancel the tasks also a the target you need to call the task management functions.
