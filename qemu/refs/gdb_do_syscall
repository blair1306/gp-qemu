 * Send a GDB syscall request. This function will return immediately;
 * the callback function will be called later when the remote system
 * call has completed.
 *
 * @fmt should be in the &apos;call-id,parameter,parameter...&apos; format documented
 * for the F request packet in the GDB remote protocol. A limited set of
 * printf-style format specifiers is supported:
 *   %x  - target_ulong argument printed in hex
 *   %lx - 64-bit argument printed in hex
 *   %s  - string pointer (target_ulong) and length (int) pair
