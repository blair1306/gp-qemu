 * Read &apos;size&apos; bytes of data from the file.
 * &apos;size&apos; can be larger than the internal buffer.
 *
 * The data:
 *   may be held on an internal buffer (in which case *buf is updated
 *     to point to it) that is valid until the next qemu_file operation.
 * OR
 *   will be copied to the *buf that was passed in.
 *
 * The code tries to avoid the copy if possible.
 *
 * It will return size bytes unless there was an error, in which case it will
 * return as many as it managed to read (assuming blocking fd&apos;s which
 * all current QEMUFile are)
 *
 * Note: Since **buf may get changed, the caller should take care to
 *       keep a pointer to the original buffer if it needs to deallocate it.
