 * Structure storing a peer
 *
 * Each time a client connects to an ivshmem server, it is advertised to
 * all connected clients through the unix socket. When our ivshmem
 * client receives a notification, it creates a IvshmemClientPeer
 * structure to store the infos of this peer.
 *
 * This structure is also used to store the information of our own
 * client in (IvshmemClient)-&gt;local.
