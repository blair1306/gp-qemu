 * The generic window quirks operate on an address and data register,
 * vfio_generic_window_address_quirk handles the address register and
 * vfio_generic_window_data_quirk handles the data register.  These ops
 * pass reads and writes through to hardware until a value matching the
 * stored address match/mask is written.  When this occurs, the data
 * register access emulated PCI config space for the device rather than
 * passing through accesses.  This enables devices where PCI config space
 * is accessible behind a window register to maintain the virtualization
 * provided through vfio.
