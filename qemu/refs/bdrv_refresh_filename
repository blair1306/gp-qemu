 *                    which (mostly) equals the given BDS (even without any

 *                    results, but caching etc. may be different)
 *  - full_open_options: Options which, when given when opening a block device
 *                       (without a filename), result in a BDS (mostly)
 *                       equalling the given one
 *  - filename: If exact_filename is set, it is copied here. Otherwise,
 *              full_open_options is converted to a JSON object, prefixed with
