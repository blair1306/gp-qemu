 * Add new bs contents at the top of an image chain while the chain is
 * live, while keeping required fields on the top layer.
 *
 * This will modify the BlockDriverState fields, and swap contents
 * between bs_new and bs_top. Both bs_new and bs_top are modified.
 *
 * bs_new must not be attached to a BlockBackend.
 *
 * This function does not create any image files.
 *
 * bdrv_append() takes ownership of a bs_new reference and unrefs it because
 * that&apos;s what the callers commonly need. bs_new will be referenced by the old
 * parents of bs_top after bdrv_append() returns. If the caller needs to keep a
 * reference of its own, it must call bdrv_ref().
