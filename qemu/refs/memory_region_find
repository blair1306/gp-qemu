<doc f='codebrowser/include/exec/memory.h' l='1449'>/**
 * memory_region_find: translate an address/size relative to a
 * MemoryRegion into a #MemoryRegionSection.
 *
 * Locates the first #MemoryRegion within @mr that overlaps the range
 * given by @addr and @size.
 *
 * Returns a #MemoryRegionSection that describes a contiguous overlap.
 * It will have the following characteristics:
 *    .@size = 0 iff no overlap was found
 *    .@mr is non-%NULL iff an overlap was found
 *
 * Remember that in the return value the @offset_within_region is
 * relative to the returned region (in the .@mr field), not to the
 * @mr argument.
 *
 * Similarly, the .@offset_within_address_space is relative to the
 * address space that contains both regions, the passed and the
 * returned one.  However, in the special case where the @mr argument
 * has no container (and thus is the root of the address space), the
 * following will hold:
 *    .@offset_within_address_space &gt;= @addr
 *    .@offset_within_address_space + .@size &lt;= @addr + @size
 *
 * @mr: a MemoryRegion within which @addr is a relative address
 * @addr: start of the area within @as to be searched
 * @size: size of the area to be searched
