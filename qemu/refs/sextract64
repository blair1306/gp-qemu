<doc f='codebrowser/include/qemu/bitops.h' l='347'>/**
 * sextract64:
 * @value: the value to extract the bit field from
 * @start: the lowest bit in the bit field (numbered from 0)
 * @length: the length of the bit field
 *
 * Extract from the 64 bit input @value the bit field specified by the
 * @start and @length parameters, and return it, sign extended to
 * an int64_t (ie with the most significant bit of the field propagated
 * to all the upper bits of the return value). The bit field must lie
 * entirely within the 64 bit word. It is valid to request that
 * all 64 bits are returned (ie @length 64 and @start 0).
 *
 * Returns: the sign extended value of the bit field extracted from the
 * input value.
