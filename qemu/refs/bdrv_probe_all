 * Guess image format by probing its contents.
 * This is not a good idea when your image is raw (CVE-2008-2004), but
 * we do it anyway for backward compatibility.
 *
 * @buf         contains the image&apos;s first @buf_size bytes.
 * @buf_size    is the buffer size in bytes (generally BLOCK_PROBE_BUF_SIZE,
 *              but can be smaller if the image file is smaller)
 * @filename    is its filename.
 *
 * For all block drivers, call the bdrv_probe() method to get its
 * probing score.
 * Return the first block driver with the highest probing score.
