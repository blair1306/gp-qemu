	 * Byte Length of valid IV/Counter
	 *
	 * For block ciphers in CBC or F8 mode, or for Kasumi in F8 mode, or for
	 *   SNOW3G in UEA2 mode, this is the length of the IV (which
	 *   must be the same as the block length of the cipher).
	 * For block ciphers in CTR mode, this is the length of the counter
	 *   (which must be the same as the block length of the cipher).
	 * For AES-XTS, this is the 128bit tweak, i, from IEEE Std 1619-2007.
	 *
	 * The IV/Counter will be updated after every partial cryptographic
	 * operation.
