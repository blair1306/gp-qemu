 * struct qht_map - structure to track an array of buckets
 * @rcu: used by RCU. Keep it as the top field in the struct to help valgrind
 *       find the whole struct.
 * @buckets: array of head buckets. It is constant once the map is created.
 * @n_buckets: number of head buckets. It is constant once the map is created.
 * @n_added_buckets: number of added (i.e. &quot;non-head&quot;) buckets
 * @n_added_buckets_threshold: threshold to trigger an upward resize once the
 *                             number of added buckets surpasses it.
 *
 * Buckets are tracked in what we call a &quot;map&quot;, i.e. this structure.
