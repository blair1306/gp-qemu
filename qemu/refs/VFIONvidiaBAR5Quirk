 * The second quirk is documented in envytools.  The I/O port BAR5 is just
 * a set of address/data ports to the MMIO BARs.  The BAR we care about is
 * again BAR0.  This backdoor is apparently a bit newer than the one above
 * so we need to not only trap 256 bytes @0x1800, but all of PCI config
 * space, including extended space is available at the 4k @0x88000.
