 * Note: reading partially-updated pointers in @pointers could lead to
 * segfaults. We thus access them with atomic_read/set; this guarantees
 * that the compiler makes all those accesses atomic. We also need the
 * volatile-like behavior in atomic_read, since otherwise the compiler
 * might refetch the pointer.
 * atomic_read&apos;s are of course not necessary when the bucket lock is held.
 *
 * If both ht-&gt;lock and b-&gt;lock are grabbed, ht-&gt;lock should always
 * be grabbed first.
