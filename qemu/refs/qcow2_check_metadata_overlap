 * Checks if the given offset into the image file is actually free to use by
 * looking for overlaps with important metadata sections (L1/L2 tables etc.),
 * i.e. a sanity check without relying on the refcount tables.
 *
 * The ign parameter specifies what checks not to perform (being a bitmask of
 * QCow2MetadataOverlap values), i.e., what sections to ignore.
 *
 * Returns:
 * - 0 if writing to this offset will not affect the mentioned metadata
 * - a positive QCow2MetadataOverlap value indicating one overlapping section
 * - a negative value (-errno) indicating an error while performing a check,
 *   e.g. when bdrv_read failed on QCOW2_OL_INACTIVE_L2
