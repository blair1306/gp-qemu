 * bdrv_measure:
 * @drv: Format driver
 * @opts: Creation options for new image
 * @in_bs: Existing image containing data for new image (may be NULL)
 * @errp: Error object
 * Returns: A #BlockMeasureInfo (free using qapi_free_BlockMeasureInfo())
 *          or NULL on error
 *
 * Calculate file size required to create a new image.
 *
 * If @in_bs is given then space for allocated clusters and zero clusters
 * from that image are included in the calculation.  If @opts contains a
 * backing file that is shared by @in_bs then backing clusters may be omitted
 * from the calculation.
 *
 * If @in_bs is NULL then the calculation includes no allocated clusters
 * unless a preallocation option is given in @opts.
 *
 * Note that @in_bs may use a different BlockDriver from @drv.
 *
 * If an error occurs the @errp pointer is set.
