 * Drops images above &apos;base&apos; up to and including &apos;top&apos;, and sets the image
 * above &apos;top&apos; to have base as its backing file.
 *
 * Requires that the overlay to &apos;top&apos; is opened r/w, so that the backing file
 * information in &apos;bs&apos; can be properly updated.
 *
 * E.g., this will convert the following chain:
 * bottom &lt;- base &lt;- intermediate &lt;- top &lt;- active
 *
 * to
 *
 * bottom &lt;- base &lt;- active
 *
 * It is allowed for bottom==base, in which case it converts:
 *
 * base &lt;- intermediate &lt;- top &lt;- active
 *
 * to
 *
 * base &lt;- active
 *
 * If backing_file_str is non-NULL, it will be used when modifying top&apos;s
 * overlay image metadata.
 *
 * Error conditions:
 *  if active == top, that is considered an error
