 * timer_new_us:
 * @type: the clock type to associate with the timer
 * @cb: the callback to call when the timer expires
 * @opaque: the opaque pointer to pass to the callback
 *
 * The default timer list has one special feature: in icount mode,
 * %QEMU_CLOCK_VIRTUAL timers are run in the vCPU thread.  This is
 * not true of other timer lists, which are typically associated
 * with an AioContext---each of them runs its timer callbacks in its own
 * AioContext thread.
 *
 * Create a new timer with microsecond scale on the default timer list
 * associated with the clock.
 *
 * Returns: a pointer to the newly created timer
