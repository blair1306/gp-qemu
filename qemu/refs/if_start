 * Send a packet
 * We choose a packet based on its position in the output queues;
 * If there are packets on the fastq, they are sent FIFO, before
 * everything else.  Otherwise we choose the first packet from the
 * batchq and send it.  the next packet chosen will be from the session
 * after this one, then the session after that one, and so on..  So,
 * for example, if there are 3 ftp session&apos;s fighting for bandwidth,
 * one packet will be sent from the first session, then one packet
 * from the second session, then one packet from the third, then back
 * to the first, etc. etc.
