 * QIOChannelTLS
 *
 * The QIOChannelTLS class provides a channel wrapper which
 * can transparently run the TLS encryption protocol. It is
 * usually used over a TCP socket, but there is actually no
 * technical restriction on which type of master channel is
 * used as the transport.
 *
 * This channel object is capable of running as either a
 * TLS server or TLS client.
