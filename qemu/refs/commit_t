 * Idea of the write support (use snapshot):
 *
 * 1. check if all data is consistent, recording renames, modifications,
 *    new files and directories (in s-&gt;commits).
 *
 * 2. if the data is not consistent, stop committing
 *
 * 3. handle renames, and create new files and directories (do not yet
 *    write their contents)
 *
 * 4. walk the directories, fixing the mapping and direntries, and marking
 *    the handled mappings as not deleted
 *
 * 5. commit the contents of the files
 *
 * 6. handle deleted files and directories
