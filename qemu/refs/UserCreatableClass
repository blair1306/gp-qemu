 * UserCreatableClass:
 * @parent_class: the base class
 * @complete: callback to be called after @obj&apos;s properties are set.
 * @can_be_deleted: callback to be called before an object is removed
 * to check if @obj can be removed safely.
 *
 * Interface is designed to work with -object/object-add/object_add
 * commands.
 * Interface is mandatory for objects that are designed to be user
 * creatable (i.e. -object/object-add/object_add, will accept only
 * objects that inherit this interface).
 *
 * Interface also provides an optional ability to do the second
 * stage * initialization of the object after its properties were
 * set.
 *
 * For objects created without using -object/object-add/object_add,
 * @user_creatable_complete() wrapper should be called manually if
 * object&apos;s type implements USER_CREATABLE interface and needs
 * complete() callback to be called.
