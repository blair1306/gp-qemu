<doc f='codebrowser/include/qemu/cutils.h' l='104'>/**
 * qemu_strsep:
 * @input: pointer to string to parse
 * @delim: string containing delimiter characters to search for
 *
 * Locate the first occurrence of any character in @delim within
 * the string referenced by @input, and replace it with a NUL.
 * The location of the next character after the delimiter character
 * is stored into @input.
 * If the end of the string was reached without finding a delimiter
 * character, then NULL is stored into @input.
 * If @input points to a NULL pointer on entry, return NULL.
 * The return value is always the original value of *@input (and
 * so now points to a NUL-terminated string corresponding to the
 * part of the input up to the first delimiter).
 *
 * This function has the same behaviour as the BSD strsep() function.
 *
 * Returns: the pointer originally in @input.
