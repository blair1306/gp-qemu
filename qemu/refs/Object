 * Object:
 *
 * The base for all objects.  The first member of this object is a pointer to
 * a #ObjectClass.  Since C guarantees that the first member of a structure
 * always begins at byte 0 of that structure, as long as any sub-object places
 * its parent as the first member, we can cast directly to a #Object.
 *
 * As a result, #Object contains a reference to the objects type as its
 * first member.  This allows identification of the real type of the object at
 * run time.
