     * Let the sysbus device format its own non-PIO, non-MMIO unit address.
     *
     * Sometimes a class of SysBusDevices has neither MMIO nor PIO resources,
     * yet instances of it would like to distinguish themselves, in
     * OpenFirmware device paths, from other instances of the same class on the
     * sysbus. For that end we expose this callback.
     *
     * The implementation is not supposed to change *@dev, or incur other
     * observable change.
     *
     * The function returns a dynamically allocated string. On error, NULL
     * should be returned; the unit address portion of the OFW node will be
     * omitted then. (This is not considered a fatal error.)
