 * Asynchronous call to perform an ISCSI discovery.
 *
 * discoveries can only be done on connected and logged in discovery sessions.
 *
 * Returns:
 *  0 if the call was initiated and a discovery  will be attempted. Result
 *    of the logout will be reported through the callback function.
 * &lt;0 if there was an error. The callback function will not be invoked.
 *
 * Callback parameters :
 * status can be either of :
 *    ISCSI_STATUS_GOOD     : Discovery was successful. Command_data is a
 *                            pointer to a iscsi_discovery_address list of
 *                            structures.
 *                            This list of structures is only valid for the
 *                            duration of the callback and all data will be
 *                            freed once the callback returns.
 *    ISCSI_STATUS_CANCELLED: Discovery was aborted. Command_data is NULL.
