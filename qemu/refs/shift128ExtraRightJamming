| Shifts the 192-bit value formed by concatenating `a0&apos;, `a1&apos;, and `a2&apos; right
| by 64 _plus_ the number of bits given in `count&apos;.  The shifted result is
| at most 128 nonzero bits; these are broken into two 64-bit pieces which are
| stored at the locations pointed to by `z0Ptr&apos; and `z1Ptr&apos;.  The bits shifted
| off form a third 64-bit result as follows:  The _last_ bit shifted off is
| the most-significant bit of the extra result, and the other 63 bits of the
| extra result are all zero if and only if _all_but_the_last_ bits shifted off
| were all zero.  This extra result is stored in the location pointed to by
| `z2Ptr&apos;.  The value of `count&apos; can be arbitrarily large.
|     (This routine makes more sense if `a0&apos;, `a1&apos;, and `a2&apos; are considered
| to form a fixed-point value with binary point between `a1&apos; and `a2&apos;.  This
| fixed-point value is shifted right by the number of bits given in `count&apos;,
| and the integer part of the result is returned at the locations pointed to
| by `z0Ptr&apos; and `z1Ptr&apos;.  The fractional part of the result may be slightly
| corrupted as described above, and is returned at the location pointed to by
| `z2Ptr&apos;.)
