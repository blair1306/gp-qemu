 * CPUState:
 * @cpu_index: CPU index (informative).
 * @nr_cores: Number of cores within this CPU package.
 * @nr_threads: Number of threads within this CPU.
 * @running: #true if CPU is currently running (lockless).
 * @has_waiter: #true if a CPU is currently waiting for the cpu_exec_end;
 * valid under cpu_list_lock.
 * @created: Indicates whether the CPU thread has been successfully created.
 * @interrupt_request: Indicates a pending interrupt request.
 * @halted: Nonzero if the CPU is in suspended state.
 * @stop: Indicates a pending stop request.
 * @stopped: Indicates the CPU has been artificially stopped.
 * @unplug: Indicates a pending CPU unplug request.
 * @crash_occurred: Indicates the OS reported a crash (panic) for this CPU
 * @singlestep_enabled: Flags for single-stepping.
 * @icount_extra: Instructions until next timer event.
 * @icount_decr: Low 16 bits: number of cycles left, only used in icount mode.
 * High 16 bits: Set to -1 to force TCG to stop executing linked TBs for this
 * CPU and return to its top level loop (even in non-icount mode).
 * This allows a single read-compare-cbranch-write sequence to test
 * for both decrementer underflow and exceptions.
 * @can_do_io: Nonzero if memory-mapped IO is safe. Deterministic execution
 * requires that IO only be performed on the last instruction of a TB
 * so that interrupts take effect immediately.
 * @cpu_ases: Pointer to array of CPUAddressSpaces (which define the
 *            AddressSpaces this CPU has)
 * @num_ases: number of CPUAddressSpaces in @cpu_ases
 * @as: Pointer to the first AddressSpace, for the convenience of targets which
 *      only have a single AddressSpace
 * @env_ptr: Pointer to subclass-specific CPUArchState field.
 * @gdb_regs: Additional GDB registers.
 * @gdb_num_regs: Number of total registers accessible to GDB.
 * @gdb_num_g_regs: Number of registers in GDB &apos;g&apos; packets.
 * @next_cpu: Next CPU sharing TB cache.
 * @opaque: User data.
 * @mem_io_pc: Host Program Counter at which the memory was accessed.
 * @mem_io_vaddr: Target virtual address at which the memory was accessed.
 * @kvm_fd: vCPU file descriptor for KVM.
 * @work_mutex: Lock to prevent multiple access to queued_work_*.
 * @queued_work_first: First asynchronous work pending.
 * @trace_dstate_delayed: Delayed changes to trace_dstate (includes all changes
 *                        to @trace_dstate).
 * @trace_dstate: Dynamic tracing state of events for this vCPU (bitmask).
 *
 * State of one CPU core or thread.
