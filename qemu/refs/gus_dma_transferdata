<doc f='codebrowser/hw/audio/gusemu_hal.c' l='482'>/* Attention when breaking up a single DMA transfer to multiple ones:
 * it may lead to multiple terminal count interrupts and broken transfers:
 *
 * 1. Whenever you transfer a piece of data, the gusemu callback is invoked
 * 2. The callback may generate a TC irq (if the register was set up to do so)
 * 3. The irq may result in the program using the GUS to reprogram the GUS
 *
 * Some programs also decide to upload by just checking if TC occurs
 * (via interrupt or a cleared GUS dma flag)
 * and then start the next transfer, without checking DMA state
 *
 * Thus: Always make sure to set the TC flag correctly!
 *
 * Note that the genuine GUS had a granularity of 16 bytes/words for low/high DMA
 * while later cards had atomic granularity provided by an additional GUS50DMAHigh register
 * GUSemu also uses this register to support byte-granular transfers for better compatibility
 * with emulators other than GUSemu32
