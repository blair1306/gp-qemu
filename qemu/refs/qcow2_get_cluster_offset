 * get_cluster_offset
 *
 * For a given offset of the virtual disk, find the cluster type and offset in
 * the qcow2 file. The offset is stored in *cluster_offset.
 *
 * On entry, *bytes is the maximum number of contiguous bytes starting at
 * offset that we are interested in.
 *
 * On exit, *bytes is the number of bytes starting at offset that have the same
 * cluster type and (if applicable) are stored contiguously in the image file.
 * Compressed clusters are always returned one by one.
 *
 * Returns the cluster type (QCOW2_CLUSTER_*) on success, -errno in error
 * cases.
