 * Samples with the same &apos;x value&apos; end up in the same qdist_entry,
 * e.g. inc(0.1) and inc(0.1) end up as {x=0.1, count=2}.
 *
 * Binning happens only at print time, so that we retain the flexibility to
 * choose the binning. This might not be ideal for workloads that do not care
 * much about precision and insert many samples all with different x values;
 * in that case, pre-binning (e.g. entering both 0.115 and 0.097 as 0.1)
 * should be considered.
