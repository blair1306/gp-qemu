<doc f='codebrowser/include/qom/object.h' l='1579'>/**
 * object_child_foreach_recursive:
 * @obj: the object whose children will be navigated
 * @fn: the iterator function to be called
 * @opaque: an opaque value that will be passed to the iterator
 *
 * Call @fn passing each child of @obj and @opaque to it, until @fn returns
 * non-zero. Calls recursively, all child nodes of @obj will also be passed
 * all the way down to the leaf nodes of the tree. Depth first ordering.
 *
 * It is forbidden to add or remove children from @obj (or its
 * child nodes) from the @fn callback.
 *
 * Returns: The last value returned by @fn, or 0 if there is no child.
