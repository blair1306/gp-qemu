<doc f='codebrowser/include/exec/exec-all.h' l='38'>/* DisasContext is_jmp field values
 *
 * is_jmp starts as DISAS_NEXT. The translator will keep processing
 * instructions until an exit condition is reached. If we reach the
 * exit condition and is_jmp is still DISAS_NEXT (because of some
 * other condition) we simply &quot;jump&quot; to the next address.
 * The remaining exit cases are:
 *
 *   DISAS_JUMP    - Only the PC was modified dynamically (e.g computed)
 *   DISAS_TB_JUMP - Only the PC was modified statically (e.g. branch)
 *
 * In these cases as long as the PC is updated we can chain to the
 * next TB either by exiting the loop or looking up the next TB via
 * the loookup helper.
 *
 *   DISAS_UPDATE  - CPU State was modified dynamically
 *
 * This covers any other CPU state which necessities us exiting the
 * TCG code to the main run-loop. Typically this includes anything
 * that might change the interrupt state.
 *
 * Individual translators may define additional exit cases to deal
 * with per-target special conditions.
