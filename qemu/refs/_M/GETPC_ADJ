   the next translated guest insn.  Adjust the address backward to point to
   the middle of the call insn.  Subtracting one would do the job except for
   several compressed mode architectures (arm, mips) which set the low bit
   to indicate the compressed mode; subtracting two works around that.  It
   is also the case that there are no host isas that contain a call insn
   smaller than 4 bytes, so we don&apos;t worry about special-casing this.  */</doc>
