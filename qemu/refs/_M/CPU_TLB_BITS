<doc f='codebrowser/include/exec/cpu-defs.h' l='69'>/* TCG_TARGET_TLB_DISPLACEMENT_BITS is used in CPU_TLB_BITS to ensure that
 * the TLB is not unnecessarily small, but still small enough for the
 * TLB lookup instruction sequence used by the TCG target.
 *
 * TCG will have to generate an operand as large as the distance between
 * env and the tlb_table[NB_MMU_MODES - 1][0].addend.  For simplicity,
 * the TCG targets just round everything up to the next power of two, and
 * count bits.  This works because: 1) the size of each TLB is a largish
 * power of two, 2) and because the limit of the displacement is really close
 * to a power of two, 3) the offset of tlb_table[0][0] inside env is smaller
 * than the size of a TLB.
 *
 * For example, the maximum displacement 0xFFF0 on PPC and MIPS, but TCG
 * just says &quot;the displacement is 16 bits&quot;.  TCG_TARGET_TLB_DISPLACEMENT_BITS
 * then ensures that tlb_table at least 0x8000 bytes large (&quot;not unnecessarily
 * small&quot;: 2^15).  The operand then will come up smaller than 0xFFF0 without
 * any particular care, because the TLB for a single MMU mode is larger than
 * 0x10000-0xFFF0=16 bytes.  In the end, the maximum value of the operand
 * could be something like 0xC000 (the offset of the last TLB table) plus
 * 0x18 (the offset of the addend field in each TLB entry) plus the offset
 * of tlb_table inside env (which is non-trivial but not huge).
