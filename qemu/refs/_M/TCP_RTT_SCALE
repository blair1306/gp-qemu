 * The smoothed round-trip time and estimated variance
 * are stored as fixed point numbers scaled by the values below.
 * For convenience, these scales are also used in smoothing the average
 * (smoothed = (1/scale)sample + ((scale-1)/scale)smoothed).
 * With these scales, srtt has 3 bits to the right of the binary point,
 * and thus an &quot;ALPHA&quot; of 0.875.  rttvar has 2 bits to the right of the
 * binary point, and is smoothed with an ALPHA of 0.75.
