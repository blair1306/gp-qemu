 * The IOCTL interface is designed for extensibility by embedding the
 * structure length (argsz) and flags into structures passed between
 * kernel and userspace.  We therefore use the _IO() macro for these
 * defines to avoid implicitly embedding a size into the ioctl request.
 * As structure fields are added, argsz will increase to match and flag
 * bits will be defined to indicate additional fields with valid data.
 * It&apos;s *always* the caller&apos;s responsibility to indicate the size of
 * the structure passed by setting argsz appropriately.
