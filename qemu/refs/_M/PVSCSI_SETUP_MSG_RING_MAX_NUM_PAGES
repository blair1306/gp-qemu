 * Command descriptor for PVSCSI_CMD_SETUP_MSG_RING --
 *
 * Notes:
 * - this command was not supported in the initial revision of the h/w
 *   interface. Before using it, you need to check that it is supported by
 *   writing PVSCSI_CMD_SETUP_MSG_RING to the &apos;command&apos; register, then
 *   immediately after read the &apos;command status&apos; register:
 *       * a value of -1 means that the cmd is NOT supported,
 *       * a value != -1 means that the cmd IS supported.
 *   If it&apos;s supported the &apos;command status&apos; register should return:
 *      sizeof(PVSCSICmdDescSetupMsgRing) / sizeof(uint32_t).
 * - this command should be issued _after_ the usual SETUP_RINGS so that the
 *   RingsState page is already setup. If not, the command is a nop.
 * - numPages needs to be a power of two,
 * - numPages needs to be different from 0,
 * - pad should be zero.
