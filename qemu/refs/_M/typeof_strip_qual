<doc f='codebrowser/include/qemu/atomic.h' l='21'>/* The variable that receives the old value of an atomically-accessed
 * variable must be non-qualified, because atomic builtins return values
 * through a pointer-type argument as in __atomic_load(&amp;var, &amp;old, MODEL).

 * This macro has to handle types smaller than int manually, because of

 * converted to a non-qualified type just by applying a binary operator.
