 * The initial retransmission should happen at rtt + 4 * rttvar.
 * Because of the way we do the smoothing, srtt and rttvar
 * will each average +1/2 tick of bias.  When we compute
 * the retransmit timer, we want 1/2 tick of rounding and
 * 1 extra tick because of +-1/2 tick uncertainty in the
 * firing of the timer.  The bias will give us exactly the
 * 1.5 tick we need.  But, because the bias is
 * statistical, we have to test that we don&apos;t drop below
 * the minimum feasible timer (which is 2 ticks).
 * This macro assumes that the value of TCP_RTTVAR_SCALE
 * is the same as the multiplier for rttvar.
