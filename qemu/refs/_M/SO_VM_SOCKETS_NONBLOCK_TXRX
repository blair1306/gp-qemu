<doc f='include/linux/vm_sockets.h' l='67'>/* Option name for using non-blocking send/receive.  Use as the option name
 * for setsockopt(3) or getsockopt(3) to set or get the non-blocking
 * transmit/receive flag for a STREAM socket.  This flag determines whether
 * send() and recv() can be called in non-blocking contexts for the given
 * socket.  The value is a signed integer.
 *
 * This option is only relevant to kernel endpoints, where descheduling the
 * thread of execution is not allowed, for example, while holding a spinlock.
 * It is not to be confused with conventional non-blocking socket operations.
 *
 * Only available for hypervisor endpoints.
