 * QIOChannel:
 *
 * The QIOChannel defines the core API for a generic I/O channel
 * class hierarchy. It is inspired by GIOChannel, but has the
 * following differences
 *
 *  - Use QOM to properly support arbitrary subclassing
 *  - Support use of iovecs for efficient I/O with multiple blocks
 *  - None of the character set translation, binary data exclusively
 *  - Direct support for QEMU Error object reporting
 *  - File descriptor passing
 *
 * This base class is abstract so cannot be instantiated. There
 * will be subclasses for dealing with sockets, files, and higher
 * level protocols such as TLS, WebSocket, etc.
