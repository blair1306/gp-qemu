 * Accept the socket and connect to the local-host
 *
 * We have a problem. The correct thing to do would be
 * to first connect to the local-host, and only if the
 * connection is accepted, then do an accept() here.
 * But, a) we need to know who&apos;s trying to connect
 * to the socket to be able to SYN the local-host, and
 * b) we are already connected to the foreign host by
 * the time it gets to accept(), so... We simply accept
 * here and SYN the local-host.
