 * bs is the BlockDriverState to reopen
 * flags are the new open flags
 * queue is the reopen queue
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, non-zero on error.  On error errp will be set
 * as well.
 *
 * On failure, bdrv_reopen_abort() will be called to clean up any data.
 * It is the responsibility of the caller to then call the abort() or
 * commit() for any other BDS that have been left in a prepare() state
