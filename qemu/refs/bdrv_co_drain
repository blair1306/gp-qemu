 * Wait for pending requests to complete on a single BlockDriverState subtree,
 * and suspend block driver&apos;s internal I/O until next request arrives.
 *
 * Note that unlike bdrv_drain_all(), the caller must hold the BlockDriverState
 * AioContext.
 *
 * Only this BlockDriverState&apos;s AioContext is run, so in-flight requests must
 * not depend on events in other AioContexts.  In that case, use
 * bdrv_drain_all() instead.
