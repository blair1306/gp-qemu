 * tcg_ptr_byte_diff
 * @a, @b: addresses to be differenced
 *
 * There are many places within the TCG backends where we need a byte
 * difference between two pointers.  While this can be accomplished
 * with local casting, it&apos;s easy to get wrong -- especially if one is
 * concerned with the signedness of the result.
 *
 * This version relies on GCC&apos;s void pointer arithmetic to get the
 * correct result.
