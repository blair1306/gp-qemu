<doc f='codebrowser/include/block/block_int.h' l='783'>/**
 * bdrv_wakeup:
 * @bs: The BlockDriverState for which an I/O operation has been completed.
 *
 * Wake up the main thread if it is waiting on BDRV_POLL_WHILE.  During
 * synchronous I/O on a BlockDriverState that is attached to another
 * I/O thread, the main thread lets the I/O thread&apos;s event loop run,
 * waiting for the I/O operation to complete.  A bdrv_wakeup will wake
 * up the main thread if necessary.
 *
 * Manual calls to bdrv_wakeup are rarely necessary, because
 * bdrv_dec_in_flight already calls it.
