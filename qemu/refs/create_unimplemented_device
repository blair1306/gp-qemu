 * create_unimplemented_device: create and map a dummy device
 * @name: name of the device for debug logging
 * @base: base address of the device&apos;s MMIO region
 * @size: size of the device&apos;s MMIO region
 *
 * This utility function creates and maps an instance of unimplemented-device,
 * which is a dummy device which simply logs all guest accesses to
 * it via the qemu_log LOG_UNIMP debug log.
 * The device is mapped at priority -1000, which means that you can
 * use it to cover a large region and then map other devices on top of it
 * if necessary.
