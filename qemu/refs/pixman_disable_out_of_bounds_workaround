<doc f='include/pixman-1/pixman.h' l='910'>/* Executive Summary: This function is a no-op that only exists
 * for historical reasons.
 *
 * There used to be a bug in the X server where it would rely on
 * out-of-bounds accesses when it was asked to composite with a
 * window as the source. It would create a pixman image pointing
 * to some bogus position in memory, but then set a clip region
 * to the position where the actual bits were.
 *
 * Due to a bug in old versions of pixman, where it would not clip
 * against the image bounds when a clip region was set, this would
 * actually work. So when the pixman bug was fixed, a workaround was
 * added to allow certain out-of-bound accesses. This function disabled
 * those workarounds.
 *
 * Since 0.21.2, pixman doesn&apos;t do these workarounds anymore, so now this
 * function is a no-op.
