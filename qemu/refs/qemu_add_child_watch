 * qemu_add_child_watch: Register a child process for reaping.
 *
 * Under POSIX systems, a parent process must read the exit status of
 * its child processes using waitpid, or the operating system will not
 * free some of the resources attached to that process.
 *
 * This function directs the QEMU main loop to observe a child process
 * and call waitpid as soon as it exits; the watch is then removed
 * automatically.  It is useful whenever QEMU forks a child process
 * but will find out about its termination by other means such as a
 * &quot;broken pipe&quot;.
 *
 * @pid: The pid that QEMU should observe.
