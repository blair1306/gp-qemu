 * cpu_throttle_set:
 * @new_throttle_pct: Percent of sleep time. Valid range is 1 to 99.
 *
 * Throttles all vcpus by forcing them to sleep for the given percentage of
 * time. A throttle_percentage of 25 corresponds to a 75% duty cycle roughly.
 * (example: 10ms sleep for every 30ms awake).
 *
 * cpu_throttle_set can be called as needed to adjust new_throttle_pct.
 * Once the throttling starts, it will remain in effect until cpu_throttle_stop
 * is called.
