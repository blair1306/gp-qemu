 * Called to read a chunk of data from the client socket. The data may
 * be the raw data, or may need to be further decoded by SASL.
 * The data will be read either straight from to the socket, or
 * read via the GNUTLS wrappers, if TLS/SSL encryption is enabled
 *
 * NB, it is theoretically possible to have 2 layers of encryption,
 * both SASL, and this TLS layer. It is highly unlikely in practice
 * though, since SASL encryption will typically be a no-op if TLS
 * is active
 *
 * Returns the number of bytes read, which may be less than
 * the requested &apos;datalen&apos; if the socket would block. Returns
 * -1 on error, and disconnects the client socket.
