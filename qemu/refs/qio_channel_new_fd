 * qio_channel_new_fd:
 * @fd: the file descriptor
 * @errp: pointer to a NULL-initialized error object
 *
 * Create a channel for performing I/O on the file
 * descriptor @fd. The particular subclass of QIOChannel
 * that is returned will depend on what underlying object
 * the file descriptor is associated with. It may be either
 * a QIOChannelSocket or a QIOChannelFile instance. Upon
 * success, the returned QIOChannel instance will own
 * the @fd file descriptor, and take responsibility for
 * closing it when no longer required. On failure, the
 * caller is responsible for closing @fd.
 *
 * Returns: the channel object, or NULL on error
