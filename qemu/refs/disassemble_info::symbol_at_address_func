     If there is, the function returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.
     This is used by ports which support an overlay manager where
     the overlay number is held in the top part of an address.  In
     some circumstances we want to include the overlay number in the
     address, (normally because there is a symbol associated with
     that address), but sometimes we want to mask out the overlay bits.  */</doc>
