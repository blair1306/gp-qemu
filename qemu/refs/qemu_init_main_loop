 * qemu_init_main_loop: Set up the process so that it can run the main loop.
 *
 * This includes setting up signal handlers.  It should be called before
 * any other threads are created.  In addition, threads other than the
 * main one should block signals that are trapped by the main loop.
 * For simplicity, you can consider these signals to be safe: SIGUSR1,
 * SIGUSR2, thread signals (SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGSEGV, SIGBUS) and real-time
 * signals if available.  Remember that Windows in practice does not have
 * signals, though.
 *
 * In the case of QEMU tools, this will also start/initialize timers.
