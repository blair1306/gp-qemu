<doc f='codebrowser/include/qemu/coroutine.h' l='231'>/**
 * Write Locks the CoRwlock from a reader.  This is a bit more efficient than
 * @qemu_co_rwlock_unlock followed by a separate @qemu_co_rwlock_wrlock.
 * However, if the lock cannot be upgraded immediately, control is transferred
 * to the caller of the current coroutine.  Also, @qemu_co_rwlock_upgrade
 * only overrides CoRwlock fairness if there are no concurrent readers, so
 * another writer might run while @qemu_co_rwlock_upgrade blocks.
