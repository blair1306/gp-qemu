 * QIOChannelFile:
 *
 * The QIOChannelFile object provides a channel implementation
 * that is able to perform I/O on block devices, character
 * devices, FIFOs, pipes and plain files. While it is technically
 * able to work on sockets too on the UNIX platform, this is not
 * portable to Windows and lacks some extra sockets specific
 * functionality. So the QIOChannelSocket object is recommended
 * for that use case.
