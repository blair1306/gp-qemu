 * Called to write a chunk of data to the client socket. The data may
 * be the raw data, or may have already been encoded by SASL.
 * The data will be written either straight onto the socket, or
 * written via the GNUTLS wrappers, if TLS/SSL encryption is enabled
 *
 * NB, it is theoretically possible to have 2 layers of encryption,
 * both SASL, and this TLS layer. It is highly unlikely in practice
 * though, since SASL encryption will typically be a no-op if TLS
 * is active
 *
 * Returns the number of bytes written, which may be less than
 * the requested &apos;datalen&apos; if the socket would block. Returns
 * -1 on error, and disconnects the client socket.
