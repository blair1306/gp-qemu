 * Asynchronous call to connect a TCP connection to the target-host/port
 *
 * Returns:
 *  0 if the call was initiated and a connection will be attempted. Result of
 * the connection will be reported through the callback function.
 * &lt;0 if there was an error. The callback function will not be invoked.
 *
 * This command is unique in that the callback can be invoked twice.
 *
 * Callback parameters :
 * status can be either of :
 *    ISCSI_STATUS_GOOD     : Connection was successful. Command_data is NULL.
 *                            In this case the callback will be invoked a
 *                            second time once the connection is torn down.
 *
 *    ISCSI_STATUS_ERROR    : Either failed to establish the connection, or
 *                            an already established connection has failed
 *                            with an error.
 *
 * The callback will NOT be invoked if the session is explicitely torn down
 * through a call to iscsi_disconnect() or iscsi_destroy_context().
