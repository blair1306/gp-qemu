 *
 * This function is called from qmp_migrate_set_cache_size in main
 * thread, possibly while a migration is in progress.  A running
 * migration may be using the cache and might finish during this call,
 * hence changes to the cache are protected by XBZRLE.lock().
 *
 * Returns the new_size or negative in case of error.

 * @new_size: new cache size
