     *
     *         width:           integer given as 16.16 fixpoint number
     *         height:          integer given as 16.16 fixpoint number
     *         x_phase_bits:	integer given as 16.16 fixpoint
     *         y_phase_bits:	integer given as 16.16 fixpoint
     *         xtables:         (1 &lt;&lt; x_phase_bits) tables of size width
     *         ytables:         (1 &lt;&lt; y_phase_bits) tables of size height
     *
     * When sampling at (x, y), the location is first rounded to one of
     * n_x_phases * n_y_phases subpixel positions. These subpixel positions
     * determine an xtable and a ytable to use.
     *
     * Conceptually a width x height matrix is then formed in which each entry
     * is the product of the corresponding entries in the x and y tables.
     * This matrix is then aligned with the image pixels such that its center
     * is as close as possible to the subpixel location chosen earlier. Then
     * the image is convolved with the matrix and the resulting pixel returned.
