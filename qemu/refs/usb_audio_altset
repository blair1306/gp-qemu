 * A USB audio device supports an arbitrary number of alternate
 * interface settings for each interface.  Each corresponds to a block
 * diagram of parameterized blocks.  This can thus refer to things like
 * number of channels, data rates, or in fact completely different
 * block diagrams.  Alternative setting 0 is always the null block diagram,
 * which is used by a disabled device.
